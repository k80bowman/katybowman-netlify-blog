I have been a fan of Nikole Hannah-Jones for a long time. She is a wonder and a force and what she and everyone else involved in the 1619 Project managed to pull together is absolutely incredible. I've spent the last few days reading through the essays, stories, and poetry, nodding along with the things I knew, amazed and horrified at the things I didn't. There is really only one thing you need to read this week, and this is it.
