I've been thinking a lot lately about writing more regularly on my blog. Of course this involves a lot of wondering what I'd write about, thinking about why I'd want to have a blog at all, and a whole lot of procrastination.

How does a writer who is also a developer procrastinate? She starts thinking about re-doing her website. Because of course she can't just write and publish using the one she has. No, she needs a new content management system and maybe a complete re-design.

It's all bullshit, of course. The site I have is totally fine. Would it be nice to have a better CMS? Sure. Do I need to have it set up before I start writing? No. It's just my version of cleaning the house, a classic procrastination trope. It's a way of putting off the thing I really want to do because I'm afraid I'll fail.

What would you do if you couldn't fail? That's the question, right? I've never liked that question. Because where is the fun if you're not taking a chance? So yes, I am just as good at the procrastination game as anyone else, if not better—let's face it, building out a new website is way more fun than cleaning the house or reorganizing my closet. But maybe that's just part of the game. Maybe the procrastination, the wondering, the worrying all go hand in hand with the making, the editing, and putting my work out into the world.

Maybe procrastination is like an old friend I haven't seen for a while. They show up and of course I invite them in for tea (we are not coffee people). I am nothing if not polite. We relax for a bit and the two of us have a good chat, catch up on things. But then, after a little while, it's time for them to head home. It's been a nice visit, but I have work to do. And I'm sure we'll have the opportunity to catch up again soon.
