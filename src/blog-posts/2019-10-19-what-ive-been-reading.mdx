excerpt: >-
  I'm sitting here watching Booksmart and remembering what it was like to be a completely nerdy girl in high school.

And I'm totally OK with that. Because I read some interesting shit this week.

“Carrying luggage on a plane is a massive pain in the ass. It is an unruly practice. You have to drag the suitcase through the airport. It has to come into the bathroom stall with you.
