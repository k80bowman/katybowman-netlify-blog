I loved this book. There is so much heart and truth in it. And fumbling and teenage worry and angst and masturbation and bad sex. I want my daughter to read it when she's a bit older. I want her to know that all of this is normal and even wonderful.

Reading this book made me realize that we're never really done building ourselves. I've torn myself down and built myself back up again so many times I couldn't possibly count. And when I'm not doing a wholesale rebuild, I'm tweaking, letting go of this, holding tighter to that. The job of building yourself is never finished. And that's a beautiful thing.

This book also contains one of the most important and true lines I've ever read. "Explaining why you love something is one of the most important jobs on earth." I want to pin that line up on my wall where I can see it every day. Explaining why I love what I love is all I ever want to do.
